## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- Use the resolved event phase (`event.phase`) in feed/timeline labeling so the first advance can render as `Turno 1 · Bloodbath` when applicable.
- Keep `cycle_phase` as the post-advance global phase while exposing event-phase context for UI correctness.
- Add regression coverage in API contract and lifecycle tests for first-turn phase labeling.
